# Internet Are You OK?
Internet, are you ok? A voyage into Vue, Vuex, Nuxt and Typescript.

Most docs/descriptions are on each page, however the aims are set out in the [My SUSE Hackweek Project Page](https://hackweek.suse.com/20/projects/internet-are-you-ok-a-voyage-into-vue-vuex-nuxt-and-typescript), but TL;DR
      
- Investigate Typescript integration with Vue, Vuex and Nuxt.
- Understand how Typescript support changes in newer versions of each of the above.
- Achieve this by a fun project to determine the sentiment of the internet. This was heavily inspired by [a site](http://listen.hatnote.com/) that visually and audibly tracks the state of Wikipedia.
